## personal data visualization

### Features
- fetches data from google docs spreadsheet
- allows user to choose a dataset
- plots graph of chosen dataset (raw data + fit line)

### TODO
- scatter plot of 2 data streams
- filter data by days of week
- move filter into an object
- existing charts should not re-render when adding more charts
- move templates into separate files?
- group data into week/month groups (different than a week-long convolution filter)
- enable/disable filtered datastream
- calendar view of data: http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063318
- can choose filter properties for graph
- different graph (bar?) for yes/no data
- add license file
